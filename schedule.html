					<h4>Node is Enterprise</h4>
					<p>Node Containerization is the theme for the second day.
						The complexity of containerization has really been about the complexity of orchestrating distributed applications. But what is orchestration, really, and why are we still struggling with it when building Node.js applications? See a wholly new approach to orchestration, one that’s application-centric and developer-forward. This isn’t an orchestration product, it’s a repeatable pattern that can be implemented to containerize and orchestrate any Node.js app.</p>

									<h5>To Err Is Human</h5>
									<h6>09:30-10:30am: Elizabeth Hall</h6>
									<p>Error objects should have a place in your utility belt. They are indispensable when it comes to managing work flows in a highly asynchronous environment. This talk covers patterns for using JavaScript Error (capital E) objects to build resilient applications, and introduces some modules that can be used to build errors with an elegant history of stack traces. Try/catch, callbacks, and other error handling mechanisms will be examined, revealing some potential deficiencies in the JavaScript language for dealing with errors.</p>

			<h2>Speakers</h2>
			<p>Node Summit 2016 includes a fantastic roster of individuals who represent a broad spectrum of companies working with Node.js and within the Node.js ecosystem.
				These individuals will share their insights and experience with a focus on real-world challenges and real-world solutions that leverage Node.js. The use of Node.js in large-scale deployments has increased exponentially since the first Node Summit, and the speakers at Node Summit 2016 will highlight how significant the impact of Node.js already is and the benefits they have reaped as early adopters.</p>
